This Project Was Going To Be For My Personal Use But I Decided To Share It So Here It Is
You Can Either Look Like Some Hack Or Use It To Make Life Easier

The Commands For The Regular Terminal Are


repair system | Does The Classic DISM+SFC Scan Automatically

tweak registry | Optimizes Your Registry Settings For Gaming

display characters | Displays Unicode Characters But Kinda Broken

dos | Performs Spam Ping Towards IPS But Keeps Changing Packet Size

new ip | Changes Your Old IPv4 Address With A New IPv4 Address

adguard | Swaps Your Useless DHCP Servers With Adguard

reveal public ip | Displays Your IP Address

bomb router | Attempts To Overload Your Router

clean rubbish | Cleans Up Temp Folders


Using My Personalized Terminal Is Not Recommended
